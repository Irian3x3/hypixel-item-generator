Added Dungeonizable checkbox, to remove Dungeonizable stats / re-enable them. Also removed Dungeonized stats effecting speed and other things it shouldn't have

fixed some UI bugs

Added ability to add Image to item, including ability to change image size

Added Soulbound checkbox


Update #2

Added a Lore section, similar to the description although appears below the abilities.

Added ability to add colours to Descriptions, Lores and Abilities!
I opted into using the Minecraft colour coding system (e.g if you want text to be red you type &3Red) there is a section within the Weapons tab to go through the colour codes! (Planning on moving it somewhere soon, when I figure out where)

Added Recomb checkbox

Added Kill Counter (book of stats)
